SETUP:

IMPORTANT: To make sure the program can run the configuration files, please open phase_2_work as a new project. In IntelliJ, close your current project, 
open phase_2_work as a project and trust the project. If the intellij gives you a warning about missing Junit4, please hover your cursor over the red underlined 
words and import Junit4.

**IMPORTANT Note: Make sure you LOGOUT the program before you re-run the program, otherwise all operations performed during your login time will NOT be saved. 
Including your account data, song data, notification data.

How To Run:

Navigate to src/main/GUI.
You will see a file called gui, run this file, and you should the GUI appear on your screen.
Have fun!
Some Important Notes: After you perform some tasks, the GUI will take you directly back to the previous page, 
this means you have successfully performed the task. As long as there are no red text saying the task has failed, 
your task has been completed. We purposely design it this way when you try to rate a song to avoid one person rating a song repeatly by accident.

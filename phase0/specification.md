· The system will be a music sampler application. The purpose of a music sampler is to promote new music by giving users direct access 
     to the content and collecting metrics such as feedback (rating out of 5) and number of times the user listened to that song. 
· Running the project in IntelliJ, the terminal will prompt user to log in or exit the program.
· Once the user is logged in, while the program is running, the terminal will print prompt where user can repeatedly type commands to 
     perform administrative moves:
                                                    · Users are allowed to check their login history. 
                                                    · If the user is an admin user, they are allowed to create a new admin user by promoting an existing
                                                         non-admin user or delete a non-admin user.
· The program should also prompt user if they want to enter the home page, if user says yes the system will display a 
      UI that allows user to interact with. 
· The UI will look like a 3*3 matrix, each row will represent three songs that a certain distributor
      is promoting. We should have 9 songs that comes from 3 different distributors in total.
· At each entry of the matrix, it would display the singer of the song and the song name. 
· After user clicks on the entry, it opens a new page that contains the artist information, song name, 
      and how many times this song has been listened to/ overall rating so far(out of 5). At the bottom of the page, it will have the YouTube/Spotify link to the song. 
· User is allowed to give rating to the song. 
· At each UI page the user is allowed to go back to the previous page.

SETUP:

**IMPORTANT: To make sure the program can run the configuration files, please open phase_2_work as a new project.**
In IntelliJ, close your current project, open phase_2_work as a project and trust the project. 

**IMPORTANT Note: Make sure you  LOGOUT the program before you re-run the program, otherwise all 
operations performed during your login time will NOT be saved. Including your account data, song data, notification data.


How To Run:

1) Navigate to src/main/GUI.
2) You will see a file called gui, run this file, and you should the GUI appear on your screen.
3) Have fun!

Some Important Notes:
After you perform some tasks, the GUI will take you directly back to the previous page, this means you have successfully performed the
task. As long as there are no red text saying the task has failed, your task has been completed.  We purposely design it this way when you 
try to rate a song to avoid one person rating a song repeatly by accident.
